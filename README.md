# WordPress Zero Configuration


### Description
This project is an attempt to help you create your own WordPress Project with almost zero configuration.
This means, you just need to clone the repo and update the `wp-config.php` file in order to start your personal project.
Some plugins and helpers are already included and kept up-to-date to make you focus on development straight away.
